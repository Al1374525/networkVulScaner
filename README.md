This is a network vulneralbility scanner that i have created. This works by selecting a target iP address and take in its starting and ending ports to scan for potential vulneralbilities.
this was made possible through the use of nmap
This was used to practice my scripting skills and use and understand of what Nmap is. 
More details and maybe releases will be coming soon
